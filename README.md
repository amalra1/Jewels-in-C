## Game rules

- Match 3 or more identical jewels in a single move to make a match and watch it disappear.
- Match 4 or more gems in a row to unlock special jewels, clear the board, and increase your score faster.
- To earn the most points, fill up the color meters to complete each level and add score multipliers to your next board.
- Drag, click, or tap a jewel to move it vertically or horizontally in the direction to complete a match.
- Game ends when you run out of moves.

## Notes

- Save the highest scores in disk and show in a scoreboard;
- On the first level there are 4 types of jewels: **yellow squares**, **purple thin crystals**, **green diamons**, **red squares** and **blue circles**. After the third level, **orange hexagons** start showing up.
- A level ends when you complete a score limit, defined per level. Each time you advance a level, the jewels mix themselves in a random way, and a multiplier is increased (*1st level the multiplier is 1x, 2nd is 2x, and so on..*)
